# UrbanGreenInsights :deciduous_tree:

**"UrbanGreenInsights: Satellite Insights into Green Spaces for Sustainable Cities"** is a project focused on assessing green spaces in Tier-1 (Ahemdabad,Mumbai,Bengaluru) and Tier-2 (Surat,Vadodara,Chandigarh) cities using satellite remote sensing data. The study aims to contribute to Sustainable Development **Goal 15 (SDG-15) - "Life on Land"** by evaluating urban greenery dynamics and providing insights into sustainable urban development.
### Objectives :heavy_check_mark:
* To utilize satellite remote sensing data to assess green spaces in urban areas.
* To calculate ratios and elasticities based on built-up and vegetation classes.
* To evaluate urban greenery dynamics and determine growth percentages for various cities.
* To contribute to sustainable urban planning by providing insights into urban development trends.
### Methodology :book:
1. Data Collection: Satellite imagery data was collected for Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities.
2. Image Processing: The images were processed to classify built-up and vegetation areas.
3. Statistical Analysis: Ratios and elasticities were calculated to assess urban greenery dynamics.
4. Visualization: Visualizations were created to depict the distribution and growth of green spaces.
### Key Findings ðŸ”‘
* The project identified and quantified the growth trajectory of green spaces in specific cities.
* Growth percentages for various cities were determined, providing insights into urban development trends.
* The study highlighted the importance of urban green spaces in mitigating urban heat island effects and enhancing climate resilience.
### Contributions :triangular_flag_on_post:
* Biodiversity Conservation: Insights into preserving green spaces within urban settings.
* Urban Green Spaces: Evaluation of the current status and growth of green areas in cities.
* Sustainable Urbanization: Recommendations for integrating green spaces in urban planning.
* Climate Resilience: Analysis of the role of green spaces in mitigating climate change impacts.
### Limitations âœ‹
* The study is limited by the resolution and accuracy of the satellite imagery used.
* Temporal variations in data collection may affect the consistency of the analysis.
### Future Scope ðŸ¤”
* Expanding the study to include more cities and finer spatial resolution data.
* Incorporating additional environmental factors such as air quality and water bodies.
* Developing predictive models to forecast future trends in urban green space dynamics.
